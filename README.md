## Authors

The current version of the Thymio II robot, is an evolution of a first Thymio robot. 
Both were developed in the context of a collaboration between the [MOBOTS](http://mobots.epfl.ch/) group of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne ([EPFL](www.epfl.ch)) and the Lausanne Arts School ([ECAL](http://www.ecal.ch)).
For Thymio II, the development was supported by the [NCCR](https://www.nccr-robotics.ch/) Robotics research program, while [Mobsya association](www.mobsya.org) took part in the development and manages the production.

Initial electronics version was made by:
* Dr Fanny Riedo
